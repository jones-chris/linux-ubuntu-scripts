# linux-ubuntu-scripts

This is a repository of the shell scripts I'm writing as I progress through the "Linux Shell Scripting: A Project-Based Approach to Learning" Udemy course at the following link:

https://www.udemy.com/linux-shell-scripting-projects/

The course uses a CentOS image, but I have created these scripts using Ubuntu 18.04, so there are some differences.
